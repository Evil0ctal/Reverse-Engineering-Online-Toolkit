    "tools.frequency-analyzer.aboutDesc": "Frequency analysis is an important technique in cryptography that breaks simple substitution ciphers by analyzing character frequencies in ciphertext. In English, 'E' appears most frequently (about 12.7%), followed by 'T', 'A', 'O', etc. By comparing ciphertext character frequencies with known language frequencies, substitution rules can be deduced."
